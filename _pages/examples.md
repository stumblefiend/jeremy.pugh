See some examples of public documentation I've worked on:

- [Cloudflare 1XXX Errors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/cloudflare-errors/troubleshooting-cloudflare-1xxx-errors/)
- [New Relic - Increase User Engagement](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/website-performance-monitoring/increase-user-engagement/)
- New Relic - Cells [MHTML (recommended)](/assets/docs/cells-new-relic.mhtml) or [PDF (more secure)](/assets/docs/cells-new-relic.pdf)

I have many other examples I can provide such as job aids, references, API documentation, UX writing that are all available upon request.
