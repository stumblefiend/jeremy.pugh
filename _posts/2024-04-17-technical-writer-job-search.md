Are you a technical writer looking to stand out in a competitive job market? Are you eager to demonstrate your skills and commitment to potential employers? Look no further – actively contributing to company repositories and documentation could be the game-changer you've been searching for. Committing to company repos has helped me impress companies in the past. Recently, I was told by one docs manager that I was at the top of their list of 5 candidates because I'd already been doing my homework and getting to know their processes, systems, and documentation.

The commits don't have to be large but must be meaningful and should demonstrate what insights you have to offer. For instance, at New Relic, I made a simple commit that removed a repeat word and that was enough for the hiring manager to take note and discuss during my interview. Pro tip: ensure you make the commit from a GitHub account that matches your name and not an account with a made-up username. Plus, you don't have to make the commit until you have secured your first interview.

What if there is no public docs repo? If a company doesn't have an open source doc site, find any open source repo the company maintains and clean up the readme or contribution guidelines in one of their code repos. You'd be surprised how grateful they will be to have clearer instructions! In the past, I got my contribution guidelines merged the next day with a huge thank you and this is a great, positive talking point to mention during the interview. Of course, there are plenty of other benefits.

## Benefits of Contribution

### Demonstrating Commitment

By engaging with a company's documentation repositories, you showcase your dedication to the role and your willingness to go above and beyond. It's not just about being interested in the position; it's about being invested in the success of the organization.

### Showcasing Skills

Committing to documentation repositories allows you to tangibly demonstrate your technical writing skills. It provides concrete evidence of your ability to create clear, concise, and effective documentation that adds value to the organization's products or services.

### Understanding Company Dynamics

Contributing to company repositories isn't just about showcasing your skills – it's also about gaining insights into the organization you're considering joining. By actively participating in documentation processes, you get a firsthand look at the company's working dynamics. You can observe how responsive team members are to each other, how they communicate, and how they collaborate on projects. This information is invaluable when evaluating whether a company is the right fit for you.

### Building Relationships

Actively participating in the documentation process allows you to build relationships with other members of the team, including developers, product managers, and subject matter experts. These relationships are invaluable for a technical writer, as they facilitate collaboration and ensure the accuracy and relevance of the documentation. You'll be surprised to find the people who interview you are the same ones you worked with on the commit!

In summary, don't wait for opportunities to come to you. Start exploring the documentation repositories of companies you're interested in. Look for ways to contribute, whether it's by fixing typos, clarifying instructions, or suggesting improvements. By actively participating in company repositories, you not only demonstrate your skills and commitment but also gain invaluable insights into the organization's culture and dynamics. It's a win-win situation that can elevate your technical writing career.
